# TuyaOS All-in-One Gateway SDK

[English](./README.md) | [中文](./README_zh.md)

## Overview

With a component-based plug-and-play architecture, the TuyaOS all-in-one SDK helps you build an IoT-enabled gateway in a quick and easy way. A variety of component libraries allows you to flexibly implement and adjust your service offerings as the market needs change over time.

This SDK enables you to achieve cloud connection and integrate with gateway capabilities with low code development. You can enrich your gateway product with a host of services such as infrared, control hub, Zigbee and Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity, router, relay, and Pegasus pairing.

The components in the SDK include but are not limited to:

- The Zigbee component that helps you enable Zigbee connectivity. It must be used in tandem with Tuya's gateway-specific Zigbee module that acts as a Zigbee network coordinator. This SDK also allows you to connect proprietary Zigbee devices to the gateway so that they can interact with `Powered by Tuya` ecosystem.
- The Bluetooth component that helps you enable Bluetooth-based device pairing as well as interconnection with `Powered by Tuya` ecosystem. It must be used in tandem with Tuya's gateway-specific Bluetooth module.
- The router component that helps you quickly develop a router product.
- The basic component that helps you develop gateway products with the support for RS-433, RS-485, and Z-Wave and a suite of features like engineering mode, failover, security, local linkage, cross-gateway LAN, and more.
